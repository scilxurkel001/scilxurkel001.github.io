    <h1>Internet Explorer has retired</h1>
    <p>
      Sorry for the trouble, but Internet Explorer has been discontinued as a supported browser.
    </p>
    <h3>Why can't I access this page with Internet Explorer?</h3>
    <p>
      Internet Explorer has been discontinued and is now not W3C compliant. We do not have the ability to adapt Internet Explorer in some new ways (e.g. @font-face) and can only redirect visits from Internet Explorer to this page.
    </p>
    <h3>Why was Internet Explorer discontinued?</h3>
    <p>
      First of all, its performance is tens of times weaker than Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, and more than ten times weaker than Firefox, and browsing the web with such performance will never give you a good web browsing experience.<br>
      Then its security firewall is as if it is not there, the mainstream browsers support a series of security settings such as "block pop-ups", "dangerous URL warning", "input error warning", etc., but Internet Explorer does not even support HTTPS secure access, so if you use Internet Explorer to access the web, the system has a high probability of being infected with computer viruses.<br>
      Finally, it does not support the latest W3C standards, and there is no way to use the latest HTML features, so Microsoft has stopped supporting Internet Explorer.
    </p>
    <h3>What should I do?</h3>
    <p>
      If you are using Internet Explorer to access the web on Windows 10, download Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Firefox here to adapt to the latest W3C standards and enhance the security of your computer.<br>
      If you are still accessing the web with Internet Explorer on Windows 7 or Windows XP, please upgrade to Windows 10 or Windows 11 to better use Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox.
