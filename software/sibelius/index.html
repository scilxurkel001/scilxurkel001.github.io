        <br />
        You are about to suffer from Sibelius.<br />
        Since the Chinese version of Sibelius is represented by a jerk company and is difficult to get started, complicated to operate and has a lot of problems.
        <br />
        We recommend you to switch to MuseScore for a better experience. Here is the MuseScore page:

        No cracked version of Sibelius is available for download here.
        <br />
        If you really want to download it, please go to the official website to buy it:
