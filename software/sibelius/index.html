<br />
You are about to suffer from Sibelius.<br />
Since the Chinese version of Sibelius is represented by a jerk company and is difficult to get started, complicated to operate and has a lot of problems.
<br />
We recommend you to switch to MuseScore for a better experience. Here is the MuseScore page:
