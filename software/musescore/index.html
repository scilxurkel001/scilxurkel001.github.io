        You are about to download MuseScore!
        <br />
        <br />
        For some reasons, we do not provide individual download links in order not to interrupt this project, 
        <br />
        but since MuseScore is free and open source software, it is rather more hassle-free to use the official download links here.
        <br />
        Download MuseScore from:
        <br />
