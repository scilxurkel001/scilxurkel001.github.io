        她深知，在告别世界时，一个人理应带走属于自己的所有，以免余众哀伤。<br />
        她也同样知晓，那是自己绝对无法做到的事。<br />
        她在这世间所留下的，实在太多……遍及一切，远至永恒。<br />
        于是，她决定……要最后再任性一次。<br />
        任性地把她曾见证的所有，把她所爱的所有，把她留下的所有……<br />
        把这世间所有的一切，都汇集在一起，编纂成册——<br />
        是啊，她最终所留下的，不过就是一段故事而已。<br />
        关于曾经那美好的时代，关于那未能成为英雄的十三个人……<br />
        就只是一个这样简单的故事，仅此而已。<br />
        <br />
        She knew that in saying goodbye to the world, <br />
        one deserves to take all that belongs to him or her so that the rest of the world does not mourn.<br />
        She also knew that it was something she could never do.<br />
        What she left behind in this world was too much ...... for everything, far into eternity.<br />
        So she decided ...... to be capricious one last time.<br />
        Capriciously all that she had witnessed, all that she loved, all that she left behind ......<br />
        Bringing together everything in this world, compiling it all into one book -<br />
        Yes, what she ultimately left behind was just a story.<br />
        About the good old days, about the thirteen people who failed to become heroes ......<br />
        It's just a simple story, that's all.<br />
        <br />
